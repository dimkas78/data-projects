# BI Admin with Tableau Server

During this async project, we want to learn the key capabilities of BI Admin. This role usually assign on Data Analyst or BI Developer and it is great competitive advantage for you to have because all companies have BI servers and usually they don't have any dedicated BI Admin roles.

In the past the free Tableau courses in Coursera give a license. You can check them:

- [Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-tableau)
- [Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization-tableau?specialization=data-visualization)

# Week 1

First we should prepare everything we need before actual execute. We take into consideration, that Tabelau Trial is valid for 14 days or you may need to obtain Student License for 1 year. You may need to ask someone with student id to help you or find your old id.

Let's define the questions that we want to answer before we start.

0. Start this free course [Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-tableau) and try to catch key ideas for Tableau Desktop and maybe you even will obtain the Tableau License.
1. What is Tableau Desktop and how we can download it?
2. What options we have for Tableau Server? (i.e. Online vs Self-Hosted, Windows vs Linux)
3. What is bare mimimum hardware requirements for Tabelau Server?
4. Decide what Public Cloud provider you wnat to use got creating a trial account and a virtual machine for your Tableau Server based on hardware requirements
  - Azure
  - AWS
  - GCP
5. Create a Tableau Public Account (this is also a Tableau Server managed by Tableau).
6. Using Tableau Public find any SuporStore dashboard that looks very cool and download it. Your goal will be to recreate this dashboard later in your Tableau Desktop (trial) and publish into your Public Account. This is a great asset for the Resume.

Before we dive into the BI Admin topic, we want to make sure, we can get a license and understand key concenpts in Tableau:
- Desktop/Client
- Dimension/Measure
- Data Source/Data Model
- Live/Extract
- Workbook/View/Dashboard/Story
- Filters
- Sets
- LOD calculations
- Calculated Fields
- Parameters
- ability to decouple and understand the dashboard from Tableau Public and recreate it
