# Getting Started Snowflake and Apache Iceberg

## Objective

We want to explore the intersecation of Apache Iceberg and Snowflake. And understant the use cases.

## Key Terms

**Apache Iceberg** tables for Snowflake combine the performance and query semantics of typical Snowflake tables with external cloud storage that you manage. They are ideal for existing data lakes that you cannot, or choose not to, store in Snowflake.

Iceberg tables use the Apache Iceber open table format specification, which provides an abstraction layer on data files stored in open formats and supports features such as:

- ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions
- Schema evolution
- Hidden partitioning
- Table snapshots

Snowflake supports Iceberg tables that use the Apache Parquet™ file format.
